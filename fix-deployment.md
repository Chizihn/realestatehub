# Deployment Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed:

1. **SSR Error with Map Component**:

   - Made Map component client-side only using dynamic imports
   - Added proper client-side checks to prevent `window is not defined` errors
   - Added loading states for map components

2. **LocationPicker Improvements**:

   - Added fallback manual address input
   - Made state and city fields required
   - Improved user experience when map is loading

3. **Removed Unused Imports**:
   - Cleaned up unused imports in components

## Changes Made:

- `frontend/components/Map.tsx`: Added client-side checks and dynamic loading
- `frontend/components/LocationPicker.tsx`: Added dynamic import for Map component and manual address input
- `frontend/app/properties/[id]/page.tsx`: Added dynamic import for Map component
- `frontend/app/properties/new/page.tsx`: Removed unused imports

## Next Steps:

1. Commit and push these changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix SSR issues with Map component and improve LocationPicker"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Redeploy on Vercel - it should now build successfully

3. The app will work with or without the map - users can still create properties using manual address input

## Fallback Behavior:

- If map fails to load, users can still input addresses manually
- All location functionality works without requiring the interactive map
- The app is now fully SSR-compatible
